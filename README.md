This assignment showcases how to use SQL JOIN operations, focusing on INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN, to combine data from multiple related tables. It's designed to help learners understand relational database structure and multi-table queries.

## 📁 Tables Used

- **Customers**: Holds customer information.
- **Orders**: Contains order records linked to customers.
- **Order_Details**: Maps products to orders with quantities.
- **Products**: Stores product names and IDs.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal is to retrieve meaningful business insights by combining data from these tables using JOINs, such as:

- Which customer placed which order
- What products were ordered and in what quantity
- Displaying all products, even if they are not associated with an order

## 🔍 Key Concepts

- **INNER JOIN**: Returns only matched records from all joined tables.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.
- **Foreign Keys**: Used to link records across tables.

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

- Understand normalization and relational database structure.
- Apply JOINs effectively for reporting and insights.
- Practice query logic in real-world scenarios.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- SQL (MySQL syntax)
- MySQL Workbench
